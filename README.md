This repository serves for samples for various projects. Right now it contains the samples for swagger-core under
the java library. Each sample contains a README file with details how to run it and what to check.

## Security contact

This repository has been set to “archived” as these samples are no longer kept up to date with security patches. 
If you still wish to use these samples in production, it is highly advised to update all the dependencies to their latest versions 
to mitigate any potential security vulnerabilities from outdated dependencies. While this repo is unmaintained
, the integration pattern of Swagger Core with the demonstrated frameworks and environments are valid and applicable 
to latest version of Swagger Core v1 (master branch) and v2 (2.0 branch) as of 30/10/2023
